### Introduction
This project analyzes earthquake events in Nepal to understand seismic patterns, magnitudes, and affected regions. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature extraction, and visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, and correlation analysis. And this is what I did: cleaned the dataset, extracted key features like magnitude, depth, and location, explored distributions and summary statistics, visualized spatial and temporal trends, and calculated correlations to identify patterns in earthquake occurrences.

*Import libraries*

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px
```

## Conclusion
The earthquake analysis in Nepal reveals patterns in seismic activity, highlighting regions and time periods with higher risks. Magnitude and depth correlations provide insights into earthquake severity, while visualizations show spatial and temporal trends. Overall, the project demonstrates how data science can help monitor, understand, and prepare for natural disasters effectively.
